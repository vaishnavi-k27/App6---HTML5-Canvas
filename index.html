Brief Description of Goal of Code:
to do things in a canvas. like draw a rectangle, insert text, insert an image, and clear the canvas. fun stuff. 
 
Known Issues:
the footer sometimes covers the last button (clear canvas) on phones. I made the header text smaller so it wouldn't and you can now press
the button (which took a lot of trial and error to get to this point). but the button does work on all devices; but you can just see it 
clearest on a laptop, so please run the code on a laptop for full effect. thanks :)
